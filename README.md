## CA Dept. of Justice OpenJustice Project
### Modeling & Hypothesis Testing

Below, members of the Data Science Working Group have been charged with answering, via inferential statistics, some of the California Department of Justice's inquiries around criminal justice. These more pointed inquiries were inspired by the OpenJustice project's exploratory analyses at [OpenJustice.org](http://wwww.openjustice.org).  

Responsible DSWG Members:
+ Catherine Zhang
+ Sushma Y.
+ Peter James
+ Holly Davis
+ Jude Calvillo

#### Status, as of June 4, 2016:

+ The need for these inquiries was verified by the CA DOJ's OpenJustice team
+ Getting and cleaning data (some external data needed)
+ Divying up responsibilities between teammates

#### The Prompts

1. Which counties/agencies arrest African American juveniles at a statistically significantly higher rate than that of other counties/agencies?
    - Extending analysis to each ethnic group represented
    - Drilling down to felonies vs. misdemeanors

2. Statewide, what contextual and ethnic factors best predict the arrest of juveniles for felonies?

3. Statewide, what contextual and ethnic factors best predict the arrest of juveniles for battery, specifically?

4. For resource allocation prompt: ~. predictors to crime rate (i.e. not necessarily optimization; just a first, exploratory step)
